# Protein-Shielded-Nanocrystal-Foundry-PSNF-
A reproducible proof-of-concept repo that simulates protein-templated nanocrystal growth and shielding, predicts Month-18 milestone success with ML, and uses uncertainty-guided active learning and Pareto trade-offs to prioritize the next best experiments.
