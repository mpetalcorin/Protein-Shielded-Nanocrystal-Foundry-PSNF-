# Data Sheet: PSNF Synthetic Experiment Dataset## MotivationThis dataset is created to support a proof-of-concept workflow for:- milestone-based gating (Month-18 style),- predictive modeling and interpretability,- active learning for batch selection,- multi-objective design and Pareto selection.It is not intended to represent any single real experimental platform.## Composition- **Rows:** each row is one simulated PSNF experimental run.- **Columns:** include design knobs, derived metrics, and pass labels.### Key input fields (examples)- `reactor`: categorical (e.g., encapsulin, ferritin_rules)- `chelator`: categorical (none, weak, strong)- `redox`: categorical (mild, oxidizing, reducing)- `shield`: categorical (none, peptide_thin, protein_shell, protein_matrix_perm, sacrificial_matrix)- `pore_gating`: continuous- `luminal_charge`: continuous- `cargo_loading`: continuous- `phosphorus_free`: binary- `feed_rate`: continuous- `field_T`: continuous- `shear_s-1`: continuous- `residence_s`: continuous- `crosslink`: continuous### Key output fields (examples)- `particle_size_nm`- `size_sd_pct`- `crystalline_fraction`- `air_stability_days`- `saxs_order`- `yield_g`- `single_solid_g`- `coercivity_kOe`- `squareness`Optional physics-inspired proxy fields:- `packing_fraction`- `density_g_cm3`- `Ms_emu_g`- `Br_kG`- `BHmax_MGOe`### Labels- `m18_pass`: milestone pass label (hard thresholds)- `m36_pass`: proxy functional label (based on simplified coercivity + squareness constraints)## Data generation process- Data are generated using deterministic pseudo-random simulation with a fixed seed.- The simulator encodes plausible cause-and-effect relationships, for example:  - stronger field and shear tend to increase `saxs_order`,  - better order tends to increase `squareness`,  - better shielding tends to improve `air_stability_days`,  - chelation and gating influence particle dispersity.Numeric ranges are anchored to plausible regimes informed by PubMed-indexed literature, but all rows are synthetic.## Recommended splits- Use stratified splits on `m18_pass` to maintain rare-success proportions.- For active learning simulations, maintain chronological ordering by rounds.## UsesAppropriate uses:- Pipeline development and demonstration.- Testing active learning and multi-objective ranking.- Producing proposal-style evidence bundles (plots, tables, decision logic).Inappropriate uses:- Making claims about real PSNF performance without experiments.- Deriving real-world safety guidance.## Distribution and availability- This dataset is generated on demand by the simulator scripts.- It is not tied to human subjects or personal data.## Bias and representativeness- Because the dataset is synthetic, bias is primarily determined by simulator assumptions.- Over-represented regimes may lead to overconfident models.- Users should treat this dataset as a scaffold and replace with real measurements as soon as possible.
