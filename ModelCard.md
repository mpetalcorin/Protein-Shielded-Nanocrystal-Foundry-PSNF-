# Model Card: PSNF Month-18 Success Predictor## Model details- **Model type:** Random Forest classifier (scikit-learn)- **Primary task:** Predict probability that a candidate PSNF run will pass **Month-18 milestone gating**- **Inputs:** Experimental design knobs (categorical + continuous), optionally including derived metrics- **Output:** `P(m18_pass=1)` in [0, 1]## Intended useThis model is intended for:- **Prioritizing experiments** under a limited budget by estimating probability of meeting milestone gates.- Supporting **design-of-experiments** planning by ranking candidate settings.- Providing **interpretability** signals (feature importance, ICE curves, response surfaces).- Demonstrating an end-to-end workflow for **closed-loop optimization**.Not intended for:- Clinical decision-making.- Any safety-critical or high-stakes deployment.- Claims about real-world material performance without experimental validation.## Training data- Training uses **synthetic** data generated by the repository simulator.- Each row represents one simulated experimental run spanning:  - reactor design choice,  - growth chemistry controls,  - shield choice,  - field/flow assembly and lock-in.## Label definition`m18_pass = 1` if all of the following thresholds are satisfied simultaneously (example defaults):- yield_g > 10- single_solid_g > 1- size_sd_pct ≤ 15- crystalline_fraction > 0.40- saxs_order ≥ 0.70- air_stability_days ≥ 14Otherwise `m18_pass = 0`.## EvaluationRecommended evaluation outputs in this repository:- **Stratified K-fold cross-validation** reporting AUC and Average Precision.- **Precision–Recall curve** for rare-positive regimes.- **Confusion matrices** at multiple thresholds to align with lab budget constraints.Because the dataset is synthetic, metrics should be interpreted as internal consistency checks and workflow validation rather than a guarantee of generalization to real experimental systems.## Ethical and safety considerations- The model is trained on synthetic data and should not be used to justify real-world performance claims.- Experimental work with nanoparticles and magnetic materials should follow institutional safety standards.## Limitations- Domain shift risk: real experiments may differ due to uncontrolled variables and measurement noise.- Proxy variables (e.g., order score) are simplified.- Model uncertainty estimation uses per-tree variance, which is a heuristic.## RecommendationsBefore using with real data:- Replace simulator-derived outputs with experimentally measured values.- Refit and validate on real datasets with careful train/test separation.- Incorporate explicit uncertainty quantification and calibration.- Add provenance metadata and measurement error models.## ContactMaintainership: Mark I.R.
